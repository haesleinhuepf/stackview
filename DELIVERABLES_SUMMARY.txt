TOP 5 PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

1. Scale Bars (Issue #167)
   Effort: LOW (2 weeks)
   Impact: HIGH
   Status: High user demand, addresses open issue

2. Performance Optimization (Issue #61)
   Effort: MEDIUM-HIGH (4 weeks)
   Impact: HIGH
   Status: Critical for large images, addresses open issue

3. Multi-Image Curtain (Issue #80)
   Effort: MEDIUM (3 weeks)
   Impact: MEDIUM
   Status: User requested, extends unique feature

4. Measurement Tools
   Effort: HIGH (6 weeks)
   Impact: HIGH
   Status: Major gap vs competitors

5. 3D Volume Rendering (Issue #140)
   Effort: VERY HIGH (12 weeks)
   Impact: HIGH
   Status: Strategic differentiator, addresses open issue

================================================================================

KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

STACKVIEW'S UNIQUE STRENGTHS:
✅ Curtain view - Unique interactive comparison tool
✅ Simple API - Lowest learning curve in the space
✅ Jupyter-native - No separate application needed
✅ Lightweight - Fast startup, minimal dependencies
✅ Interactive exploration - Great for teaching

CRITICAL GAPS TO FILL:
❌ No scale bars (Issue #167) - High demand
❌ Poor large image performance (Issue #61) - Critical issue
❌ No 3D rendering (Issue #140) - Strategic gap
❌ No measurement tools - Missing professional feature
❌ Limited annotations - Needs improvement

STRATEGIC DIRECTION:
→ Maintain: Simplicity, Jupyter focus, lightweight approach
→ Add: Professional features (measurements, 3D, scale bars)
→ Avoid: Feature bloat, competing with napari, breaking changes

MARKET POSITION:
Stackview should be the "easy napari" for quick interactive exploration
in Jupyter, not trying to match napari feature-for-feature but focusing
on simplicity and ease of use.

================================================================================

CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This comprehensive proposal package provides:
• Strategic direction for stackview development
• Detailed feature specifications with code examples
• Competitive analysis and market positioning
• Implementation roadmap with timelines
• Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
• Testing and documentation plans

All proposals maintain backward compatibility and focus on enhancing
stackview's core strengths while filling critical gaps.

The next generation of stackview will be:
→ More powerful (3D, measurements, performance)
→ More professional (scale bars, export, ROI analysis)
→ Still simple (maintain API, no feature bloat)
→ Still Jupyter-native (no desktop app)

Ready for community review and discussion!
